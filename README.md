## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The chatbot operates as a **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) agent** built with LangChain and LangGraph. It follows a structured, two-phase process defined by a detailed system prompt:

1.  **Profiling Phase**: The agent first gathers all necessary information from the user by asking a series of targeted questions. It will not provide any recommendations until this phase is complete.
2.  **Discussion Phase**: Once a user profile is established, the agent uses its tools (`search_the_web`, `get_stock_price`, `get_crypto_price`) to research the current market. It then synthesizes this data with the user's profile to generate a structured investment plan. Following the recommendation, the user can freely ask any related or new questions.

This intelligent, tool-augmented approach ensures the advice is not only personalized but also timely and relevant.
